Versioning

The required_version setting can be used to constrain which version of the Terraform CLI can be used with your configuration. 
If the running version of Terraform doesn't match the constraints specified, Terraform will produce an error and exit without taking 
any further actions.

terraform {
 required_version = ">= 0.12"
}

=======================================================================================================================================================
We can also specify a provider version requirement

provider "aws" {
region = "us-east-1"
version = ">= 2.9.0"
}

=======================================================================================================================================================
we can delete the particular resource in the cloud

target option allow to destroy only one resource, for example a S3 bucket:
$ terraform destroy -target aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket
=======================================================================================================================================================
Refreshing the State:
When you run terraform refresh, Terraform communicates with your cloud provider's API to query the current state of all the resources
you have defined in your configuration. It then updates its state file to reflect the actual state of those resources in the cloud.

No Modifications:
Importantly, terraform refresh only updates Terraform's state file; it does not make any modifications to the actual resources in your
cloud provider. It's a read-only operation that helps Terraform understand the current state of the resources.

Terraform update its state file with the latest information about the existing resources without making any changes to those
resources

Current State vs. Actual Resources:
Over time, the state in your Terraform configuration might become out of sync with the actual resources in your cloud provider. 
This could happen due to manual changes made directly in the cloud console or changes made by other processes or tools.
=======================================================================================================================================================

The terraform console command is particularly useful for experimenting with expressions, testing variable values, and understanding 
how Terraform functions work. It can help you verify the behavior of functions and expressions before using them in your actual 
Terraform configuration files.

or for debugging the defined values in the configuation is correct or not and it will print the value of the variable or 
function value

Remember that the terraform console session operates in the context of the current directory's configuration files and state, 
so the expressions and variables you use should match the ones defined in that context.


1) Navigate to the directory containing your Terraform configuration files.

2) Run the following command to start the interactive console:

terraform console
Once the console is open, you can start entering expressions and functions to see their results. For example, you can 

var.my_variable
element(["a", "b", "c"], 1)

3) Press Enter to see the result of each expression.

4) To exit the console, type exit() or press Ctrl + D.

=======================================================================================================================================================
Terraform Graph
The terraform graph command is used to generate a visual representation of either a configuration or execution plan. The output 
is in the DOT format, which can be used by GraphViz to generate charts.

=======================================================================================================================================
terraform fmt

it will check the indentation and syntax of the terraform and it will rewrite the .tf configuration file.
The terraform fmt command is used to rewrite Terraform configuration files to a canonical format and style. This command applies 
a subset of the Terraform language style conventions, along with other minor adjustments for readability.
=======================================================================================================================================================
terraform validate

The terraform validate command is used to validate the indentation,syntax and structure of your Terraform configuration files, checking for 
any potential errors that could prevent successful execution of your Terraform plans and deployments.

1) post-save check in a text before executing the terraform plan command
=======================================================================================================================================================
terraform taint <resource name> <aws_security_group.mysecuritygroup>

the terraform taint command is used to mark a resource as "tainted," which means that Terraform will consider the resource as 
needing to be recreated during the next terraform apply operation. This can be useful when you want to trigger the recreation 
of a specific resource due to changes in its configuration or dependencie.

The terraform taint command manually marks a Terraform-managed resource as tainted, forcing it to be destroyed and recreated on 
the next apply.

This command will not modify infrastructure but does modify the state file in order to mark a resource as tainted. Once a resource 
is marked as tainted, the next plan will show that the resource will be destroyed and recreated and the next apply will implement 
this change.
=======================================================================================================================================================

user data
Amazon Web Services (AWS), user data is a feature that allows you to run scripts or execute commands when you launch an EC2 instance.
This can be incredibly useful for automating instance setup, configuration, and application deployment. When an EC2 instance is 
launched with user data, the data is passed to the instance's operating system, and you can use it to perform various tasks during 
the instance's initialization.
In this blog, we are going to assign user-data to AWS instance with the help of terraform.

so create the script.sh file and write the custom script and define the script in the terradoe file

  user_data = file("${path.module}/script.sh")
=======================================================================================================================================================
provisioners

Terraform, provisioners are used to execute scripts or commands on a resource after it's created or updated. Provisioners are 
often used to perform tasks such as configuring software, initializing databases, and performing post-deployment actions. While 
provisioners can be useful in certain scenarios, it's important to use them judiciously and consider other approaches like 
configuration management tools or user data scripts when appropriate.

File Provisioner

The file provisioner is used to copy files or directories from the machine executing Terraform to the newly created resource. 
The file provisioner supports both ssh and winrm type connections.

 provisioner "file" {
    source      = "readme.md"      # terraform machine
    destination = "/tmp/readme.md" # remote machine
  }
connection {
    type        = "ssh"
    user        = "ubuntu"
    private_key = file("${path.module}/id_rsa")
    host        = "${self.public_ip}"  or "aws_instance_ip"
  }
=======================================================================================================================================================

we can pass the multiple provisioners from the same connection source 

 connection {
    type        = "ssh"
    user        = "ubuntu"
    private_key = file("${path.module}/id_rsa")
    host        = self.public_ip
  }
  # file, local-exec, remote-exec
  provisioner "file" {
    source      = "readme.md"      # terraform machine
    destination = "/tmp/readme.md" # remote machine
  }
  provisioner "file" {
    content     = "this is test content" # terraform machine
    destination = "/tmp/content.md"      # remote machine
  }

=======================================================================================================================================================
local-exec provisioners

Local-exec Provisioner:
The local-exec provisioner allows you to run scripts or commands on the machine where Terraform is being executed. This provisioner 
is often used to perform tasks on the local machine after resource creation.
if we need to execute the command to get the files from the deployed 
machine to the machine where we are executing the terraform
=======================================================================================================================================================
Remote-exec Provisioner:
The remote-exec provisioner allows you to run scripts or commands on the created resource, typically through SSH for Linux instances
or WinRM for Windows instances. Use this provisioner with caution, as it requires the instance to be reachable and correctly 
configured for SSH or WinRM access.

so from where we are executing the terraform from that machine and 
to connect to the deployed machine and login and if we need to execute the command
we use the remote exec

provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "ifconfig > /tmp/ifconfig.output",
      "echo 'hello gaurav'>/tmp/test.txt"
    ]
  }
  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    script = "./testscript.sh"
  }
}
=======================================================================================================================================================

5)Data sources
If you deploy your resources out of terraform and use them in your terraform code the way you use them through “data sources”
Data sources in terraform are used to get information about resources external to terraform and use them to set up your terraform 
resources.
Use this data source to get information about a workspace in AWS Workspaces Service.
 Data sources allow you to gather information about these resources and use that information within your Terraform 
configuration.

Eg)1 to get the info of the instance
data "aws_instance" "foo" {
instance_id = "i-instanceid"
filter {
 name = "image-id"
 values = ["ami-xxxxxxxx"]
}
filter {
 name = "tag:Name"
 values = ["instance-name-tag"]
}
}
data "aws_workspaces_workspace" "example" {
workspace_id = "ws-cj5xcxsz5"
}
data "aws_workspaces_workspace" "example" {
directory_id = "d-9967252f57"
user_name = "Example"
}

Scanerio:
So if I created the resources in the aws using the graphical or aws cli or cloud formation 
and later I am trying to create the services from the terraform so the terraform needs to 
know what and all the resources created with respect to what.
To get that information we have the data sources whatit will do it will get the 
infrastructure information and store it ina statefile .so while creation of the resources it 
will read this file.
So in this what we will do is in the place of the creation resource details we just add the 
data. Variables defined so that particular service information will get.
=======================================================================================================================================================
work space

Terraform starts with a single workspace named “default”.
The workspace feature of Terraform allows users to switch between multiple instances of a single configuration with a unique state file.

For local states, terraform stores the workspace states in a directory 
called terraform.tfstate.d

Terraform workspaces (formerly known as Terraform environments) are a feature that allows you to manage multiple instances of your
infrastructure configurations within a single codebase.
Workspaces provide a way to create isolated environments, each with its own set of variables and state, which can be used to deploy 
the same infrastructure with different configurations or for different purposes, such as development, testing, staging, or production.

so using the workpace we can create and maintain the multiple instance with the different configuration using the same code and the
variable file
by default it is created in the default workspace

1)Create a Workspace: You can create a new workspace using the terraform workspace new command. When you create a new workspace, 
it starts with a copy of the root module configuration, and you can customize the variables and settings specific to that workspace.

terraform workspace new dev

2) Switch Workspaces: You can switch between workspaces using the terraform workspace select command.

terraform workspace select dev

3)Workspace-specific Configuration: You can have different values for variables and settings in each workspace. 
This allows you to customize the infrastructure for each environment while keeping the main configuration codebase intact.

4)State Management: Each workspace has its own state file, which means that Terraform maintains separate state files for each workspace.
This ensures that changes in one workspace do not affect others. However, the same underlying resources are managed by all workspaces.

5)Terraform Commands: Most Terraform commands can be run with workspace-specific operations. For example, terraform plan and terraform 
apply can be used in a specific workspace to preview and apply changes for that workspace.

so hear 2 terraform.tfvars files are created and during the appply we pass the tfvars file with respect to the particular workspace

terraform apply --var-file terraform.tfvars

6)Default Workspace: When you initialize a Terraform configuration without explicitly creating a workspace, you're in the default 
workspace. Changes made in the default workspace can affect other workspaces, so it's recommended to use explicit workspaces for 
isolation.

7)Sharing Code: You can share most of the Terraform code across workspaces, using variables and conditional logic to differentiate 
configurations. This helps maintain consistency while adapting configurations for different environments.

state locking

State locking is an important aspect of Terraform's remote state management, especially when working in a collaborative environment 
where multiple people or systems might be making changes to the same infrastructure concurrently. State locking helps prevent 
conflicting changes and ensures that changes are applied in a safe and consistent manner.

Terraform supports state locking through various backend configurations. Here's how you can configure state locking:

Choose a Remote Backend: To enable state locking, you need to use a remote backend for storing your Terraform state. Common remote
backends include Amazon S3, Azure Storage, Google Cloud Storage, HashiCorp Consul, and more.

Configure Backend in Configuration Files: In your Terraform configuration files (.tf files), you need to specify the backend 
configuration. This includes the type of backend you're using, its connection details, and other settings specific to that backend.

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "my-app/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-west-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock-table"
  }
}
In this example, the s3 backend is used with an S3 bucket for storing state and a DynamoDB table for state locking.

DynamoDB Table (Optional): If you're using an S3-based backend for state storage, it's recommended to configure a DynamoDB table for
state locking. This table helps with concurrent access control by providing a mechanism for Terraform to acquire and release locks on 
the state.

Concurrency and Locking: When you run Terraform commands that require state changes, Terraform will automatically acquire a lock on 
the state. If the lock is already held by another process, Terraform will wait until the lock is released. This prevents concurrent 
changes to the same state file.

It's important to note that the exact steps and configurations can vary depending on the backend you're using. You should refer to 
the documentation of the specific backend provider for detailed instructions on how to configure state locking.

By enabling state locking, you ensure that changes to your infrastructure are applied in a controlled and synchronized manner, 
reducing the chances of conflicts and data corruption. It's an essential practice, especially in collaborative or automated 
infrastructure management scenarios.
