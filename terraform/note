Versioning

The required_version setting can be used to constrain which version of the Terraform CLI can be used with your configuration. 
If the running version of Terraform doesn't match the constraints specified, Terraform will produce an error and exit without taking 
any further actions.

terraform {
 required_version = ">= 0.12"
}
