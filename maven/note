discription obout the maven how it works 

so thedevelopes will write the codeand the that is the sorce code or the raw codeso from the maven build tool they will buid the 
application and the code wiil be in the format or the extension of the java

during the compalication of the code the maven will conver tyhe java code/file to the object file/class file
compilation -->rawcode ---> object/class file

so from the group of files that is the class/object files based on the functionality  we generate the one deliverable that is the
artifacts in the form of jar war ear files

a)where the jar files are the java archive it consists of the class files for the single functionality

b) jar files arem the wab archive it consists of the class files and the 1 or many jar files based on the funcitionality.
(note so if any web application we creating as the product/application we creating the war extension.

c) so if we want to provide the licence for the web application we create the extension as the ear or entriprise and it may consist 
of the class files or configuration files additional it consist of an licence. 

java    ->  1.class
 java    ->  2.class   ---> deliverable(jar,war,ear) 
 java    ->  3.class
