Maven 
maven is a project management tool which encompasses a project object model, aset of standards , a project life cycle ,a dependency management system , and logic for executing plugin goals at defined phases in lifecycle"
where it tries to treat the project as the model and it uses the hooks concept where according to the hooks we are divideing the project in to object and take care of the project
maven manages project build, reporting, and documentation from a central piece of information
maven is also a dependency management system so during the compilation of the java files there may be the dependency of the java file with the another java file
so the maven will manage that type of  dependency so which file need to conside the first to create the classs files and genereate the deliverables

main feature of maven
-> build tool
-> dependency management tool
-> documentation tool

pom.xml
it is a build configuration file all the configuration related to project build is defined over hear like like how to build when to build and what to build in a systematic way and contains the information like dependencies,liberaries ,plugins, config file etc and during the build it will for the pom gile in the source code

build management

-> it is the process of compiling and assembling a software system.
-> build automation is the act of scripting or automating a wide 
varity of tasks

a) compiling the scorce code
b) packaging binaries
c) running automated tests
d) deploying to producdtion system
e) creating the documentation

so thedevelopes will write the codeand the that is the sorce code or the raw codeso from the maven build tool they will buid the 
application and the code wiil be in the format or the extension of the java

during the compalication of the code the maven will conver tyhe java code/file to the object file/class file
compilation -->rawcode ---> object/class file

so from the group of files that is the class/object files based on the functionality  we generate the one deliverable that is the
artifacts in the form of jar war ear files

a)where the jar files are the java archive it consists of the class files for the single functionality

b) jar files arem the wab archive it consists of the class files and the 1 or many jar files based on the funcitionality.
(note so if any web application we creating as the product/application we creating the war extension.

c) so if we want to provide the licence for the web application we create the extension as the ear or entriprise and it may consist 
of the class files or configuration files additional it consist of an licence. 

java    ->  1.class
 java    ->  2.class   ---> deliverable(jar,war,ear) 
 java    ->  3.class
