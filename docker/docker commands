docker images-f dangling=true --> To display the dangling images(only)
To display only the stopped/exited containers - docker ps -a -f status=exited

 Display the conatiner idsthat are stopped - docker ps -aq -f status=exited

Remove all the stopped containers without prune command - docker ps -a status=exited | xargs docker rm

Remove all the images - docker images -q | xargs docker rmi

Remove images forcefully - docker images -q | xargs docker rmi --forcd

How do you delete all running container - Docker stop $( sudo docker ps -q )

Docker rm $( sudo docker ps -a -q) 

Docker ps port containerid

Stop all running containers: # docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)

Delete all stopped containers: # docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

Delete all images: docker rmi -f $(docker images -q

port is called internal port and docker host port is called external port Eg: -p 8080:80 Here 
8080 will be docker host port and 80 will be container port
6) -P - Used for automatic port mapping ie the internal port of container will be mapped with a 
port on docker host and this external port will be greater than 30000

Command to remove to stopped and running Containers
To remove stopped and running containers in Docker, you can use the docker rm command with the appropriate options.
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
docker ps -a  lists all containers, including the stopped ones.
-q option returns only the container IDs.

docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)
-f option forces the removal of running containers.

By which option while building dockerfile we can send the file In better manner

To efficiently send a file to the Docker daemon during the build process, you can leverage the COPY instruction instead of the 
ADD instruction in your Dockerfile. The COPY instruction is used to copy files or directories from the build context or local 
machine to the Docker image.

The COPY instruction is preferred over ADD when you simply need to copy files into the image without any complex features such as 
extracting archives or fetching remote resources. It is more explicit and straightforward for copying files.

COPY large_file.tar.gz /path/in/container/

To check which files have been changed inside a container, you can use the docker diff command. This command compares the file changes between the container's current state and its base image. Here's how you can use it:

Find the container ID or name using the docker ps command:
docker ps
Run the docker diff command followed by the container ID or name
docker diff <container_id_or_name>
This will show you a list of changed files and the type of change performed on each file. The output will use the following symbols to indicate the type of change:

A: Added
D: Deleted
C: Changed

How do you monitor docker in production
ChatGPT
To monitor Docker in a production environment, you can use various monitoring tools and techniques. Here are a few commonly used 
methods:

Docker Stats: Docker provides a built-in command called docker stats that gives you real-time information about the resource usage 
(CPU, memory, network, etc.) of running 
containers.

Container Monitoring Tools: There are several third-party container monitoring tools available that can provide more advanced 
monitoring capabilities. Some popular options include:

Prometheus: A widely used monitoring system with extensive support for Docker and container monitoring. It can collect and analyze 
metrics from Docker containers and provide alerts and visualization.

Grafana: A powerful open-source visualization tool that can be used with Prometheus or other data sources to create dashboards and 
visualizations for Docker container monitoring.

cAdvisor: A lightweight container monitoring tool specifically designed for Docker. It provides detailed resource usage statistics 
for each container, including CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.

Datadog: A cloud-based monitoring platform that offers Docker-specific monitoring capabilities. It provides real-time visibility into 
container performance, logs, and events.
